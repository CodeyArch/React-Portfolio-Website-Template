# React Portfolio Website Template

This simple web template allows you to create your own react based portfolio website. To get started, clone this repo and ensure you have node.js and react installed correctly. On your local machine and in your IDE, you can edit the images and icons used, the background colours, the positions and sizes of elements and just about anything else you will need to customise this template to your needs.

## Important

This template does not have a working contact form as of current. While it works on the frontend, there is no backend logic implemented and this is something you will have to implement for your own websites if you wish to use the contact form provided.

It is also important for me to note that a large portion of this codebase is AI generated. This project was started to allow me to explore chatGPT and to create a working template that I could use for my own portfolio site. I am not a professional web frontend developer and while I have taken care to correct code and implement my own logic and designs, it is not perfect in any capacity. This template may be worked on in future when I find issues or improvements
