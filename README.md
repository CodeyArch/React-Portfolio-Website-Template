# React Portfolio Website Template

This simple web template allows you to create your own react based portfolio website. To get started, clone this repo and ensure you have node.js and react installed correctly. On your local machine and in your IDE, you can edit the images and icons used, the background colours, the positions and sizes of elements and just about anything else you will need to customise this template to your needs.

# Demo
Check out the live demo [here](https://codeyarch.github.io/React-Portfolio-Website-Template/)

# Installation and Setup
To begin, install React, Node.js and Git
- [React Start Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Node Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Set up your IDE, this project was made using Webstorm but you can use other IDEs like Visual Studio Code

Then fork (optional) and clone this project 
```
git clone https://github.com/codeyarch.github.io/react-portfolio-website-template.git
```
If you are cloning from your fork, replace "codeyarch.github.io" with your own username/repo name e.g johndoe.github.io

Once you have opened the project and ensured you have installed everything correctly, open up your terminal and type 
```
npm start
```
This should open the react app in your browser, dependent on your development environment and configurations

# What to change
If you are using this template for yourself, you will need to swap out all placeholder images with your own, as well as change the name of the website and any descriptions.

Key places to look for making changes are:
- About.js
- Contact.js
- Navbar.js
- Socials.js
- projectData.js
- skillsData.js
- package.json

# Hosting

Once you are happy with your website and are ready to host, my recommendation is that you use Github Pages for your hosting needs. This is because Github Pages allow for one free website per user and unlimited project sites. My own personal portfolio site is hosted with Github Pages. 

The tutorial I followed myself is [here](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)

You can also use hosting services like Heroku, Netlify and Firebase if that is what you prefer, or you can choose to host on your own server. 

# Important

This template does not have a working contact form as of current. While it works on the frontend, there is no backend logic implemented and this is something you will have to implement for your own websites if you wish to use the contact form provided.

It is also important for me to note that a portion of this codebase is AI generated. This project was started to allow me to explore chatGPT, learn the basics of React and to create a working template that I could use for my own portfolio site. I am not a professional web frontend developer and while I have taken care to correct code and implement my own logic and designs, it is not perfect in any capacity. This template may be worked on in future when I find issues or improvements
